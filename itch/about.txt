Default Controls:

Mouse - Move paddle
Space Bar - Shift colors
Left/Right Click - Tilt paddle
Left+Right Click - Reset paddle rotation

Gameplay:

Move the paddle back and forth to reflect colored bullets.
Your paddle reflects bullets of the same color.
Press space to shift colors.

Enemies only take damage from reflected bullets of the opposite color.

Your ship (below the paddle) isn't immune to any color bullets.
Three hits means it's game over.

Killing enemies will sometimes drop a powerup.
Every powerup comes with a blessing and a curse. Be careful when picking up powerups!

Survive five waves of enemies to win, or try for a high score.
